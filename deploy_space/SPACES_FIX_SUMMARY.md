üß†‚öñÔ∏è AI Governance Architect's Codex - HuggingFace Spaces Fix Summary

## üöÄ Issues Fixed:

### 1. Gradio JSON Schema Error
- **Issue**: `TypeError: argument of type 'bool' is not iterable` in gradio_client.utils
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated gradio version to stable 4.44.0
  - Replaced problematic `gr.File` component with `gr.HTML` for better compatibility
  - Removed heavy dependencies that cause conflicts

### 2. Requirements Optimization
- **Issue**: Large folder upload warning and dependency conflicts
- **Fix**:
  - Removed heavy ML libraries (torch, transformers, etc.)
  - Fixed version conflicts with specific version pinning
  - Kept only essential dependencies for Spaces compatibility

### 3. Import Error Handling
- **Issue**: Component import failures causing app crashes
- **Fix**:
  - Added individual try/catch blocks for each component import
  - Graceful fallback to placeholder interfaces
  - Better error reporting and debugging

### 4. App Launcher Robustness  
- **Issue**: App launch failures in Spaces environment
- **Fix**:
  - Added multiple fallback layers in app_hf.py
  - Better error handling and user feedback
  - Removed problematic launch parameters

## üì¶ Updated Files:
- `requirements.txt` - Lightweight, compatible dependencies
- `app_hf.py` - Robust launcher with fallbacks
- `app.py` - Better import error handling and gr.File fix

## üåê Deployment Status:
Space URL: https://huggingface.co/spaces/fartec0/ai-governance

## üîß Next Steps:
1. The space should now load without JSON schema errors
2. Components will gracefully fallback if imports fail
3. Monitor logs for any remaining import issues
4. All core functionality should be available

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:
- Some advanced ML features may be limited due to dependency reduction
- File download functionality replaced with user-friendly messages for Spaces compatibility
- Authentication system should work with database fallbacks
